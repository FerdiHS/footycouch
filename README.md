<h2>Motivation</h2> 

Football has become one of the most popular sports in the world over the last century. 
It is played by millions of people in almost every country and is loved by fans of all ages, 
including us. As football fans, we have watched and followed numerous matches, starting from 
Serie A, Premier League, UEFA Champions League, up to the World Cup. To make things more 
exciting, there are a lot of football games based on real actual football matches. Playing 
such games has inspired us to make a similar game. We intend to make a website game “Footycouch” 
where the users are given a particular amount of money to buy footballers and get points based on 
the footballers’ performance in real matches. Moreover, one of us has been inspired by this idea 
and mentioned it in the ASEAN interview before joining NUS.


<h2>Aim </h2>

We aim to create a website game for football lovers so that they could enjoy the simulation of 
becoming a manager of a team and, based on personal experience, get more excited about watching football matches.


<h2>User Stories</h2>

As football fans, we want to be able to fill the period between football game weeks, where there are no football matches, 
with something related to football.
As football fans, we want to compete against each other in a fun and engaging way.
As football fans and people in general, we want to have something to have fun with in the middle of our hectic activities.
